I would first like to thank my thesis supervisor, Johannes Bastl, for his support and understanding before and during the thesis. At the time I contacted Johannes for the thesis I was going to be an exchange student and couldn't start the thesis right away. Johannes had kept this interesting topic for half a year until I returned to Aachen. During the thesis, Johannes also offered me a great deal of support not only regarding the thesis itself but also my personal issues.

I would also like to thank Kazuki Irie, my supervisor when I was a student assistant at the Chair of Computer Science 6. Kazuki introduced the wonderful topic of neural language models to me. When I was looking for an internship, Kazuki also gave me a lot of valuable information and advice. 

I would like to thank Simon Wiesler, my mentor when I was an intern at Amazon. It was my first internship and at that time I was a complete novice in the field of speech recognition. Simon gave me strong support, understanding, encouragement and recognition.

Finally, I would like to thank Bing Zhang, Tim Ng and Zhen Huang, my mentors during my internship at Apple, for their support both professionally and personally during and after the internship.
