%TOdo add all you chapter or Sections in a seperated file 
% \include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before and after \input{filename}, together with some magic to switch to another .aux file.
% It omits the inclusion at all if you have an \includeonly without the filename in the argument. This is primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow computer; 
% changing one of the include targets won't force you to regenerate the outputs of all the rest.

%\includeonly introduction % would only build the selected section
